Historically these values come from the laboratory domain, and these codes are extensively    used. The value set binding is extensible, so codes outside the value set that are needed for interpretation concepts    (i.e. particular meanings) that are not included in the value set can be used, and these new codes may also be added to    the value set and published in a future version.","StructureDefinition/pco-caregiver-gas-score,StructureDefinition/pco-practitioner-gas-score,StructureDefinition/pco-patient-gas-score","THO (V3)"
