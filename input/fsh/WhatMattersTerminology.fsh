    "Our physical, mental, and emotional health are impacted by the amount and kind of movement we do. Moving the body can take many forms such as dancing, walking, gardening, yoga, and exercise."
* #mind "Power of the Mind"
    "Our thoughts are powerful and can affect our physical, mental, and emotional health. Changing our mindset can aid in healing and coping. Breathing techniques, guided imagery, Tai Chi, yoga, or gratitude can buffer the impact of stress and other emotions."
* #nourishment "Food & Drink"
    "What we eat and drink can have a huge effect on how we experience life, both physically and mentally. Energy, mood, weight, how long we live, and overall health are all impacted by what and how we choose to eat and drink."
* #recharge "Recharge"
    "Our bodies and minds must rest and recharge in order to optimize our health. Getting a good night's rest, as well as recharging our mental and physical energy throughout the day, are vital to well-being. Taking short breaks or doing something you enjoy or feels good for moments throughout the day are examples of ways to refresh."

* #relationships "Family, Friends & Co-Workers"
    "Our relationships, including those with pets, have as significant an effect on our physical and emotional health as any other factor associated with well-being. Spending more time in relationships that \"fuel\" us and less in relationships that \"drain\" us is one potential option. Improving our relationship skills or creating new relationships through community activities are other options to consider."
* #professional-care "Professional Care"
    "Staying up to date on prevention and understanding your health concerns, care options, treatment plan, and their role in your health."
