### Identify What Matters

Coming soon!

Many alternative tools have been developed and are in use that enable individuals to reflect on What Matters Most for their health & well-being. One example is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs [Whole Health approach to care](https://va.gov/wholehealth) that includes a [Circle of Health](https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTH/circle-of-health/index.asp) and [Personal Health Inventory](https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTH/docs/PHI_Jan2022_Final_508.pdf). The examples in this FHIR IG are based on VA's approach, but can be adapted to other assessments used by different organizations or for targeted patient populations.
