### Identify What Matters

Dorothy’s primary care physician refers her to a Board Certified Health & Wellness Coach to elicit and document Dorothy’s values and priorities for improving her health and well-being. Her coach asked Dorothy to complete a Personal Health Inventory with nine lifestyle areas including Moving the Body, Food & Drink, Family & Friends, Power of the Mind, and more. For each area, Dorothy rated herself with a number between 1 (low) and 5 (high) that best represents where she is now, and where she wants to be.

Two areas of her personal assessment stood out: Dorothy rated Friends & Family at 1 now with a desire to reach 4. She also rated Food & Drink at 2 now with a desire to reach 5. At the conclusion of this first health coaching session, their objective is to identify what matters most to Dorothy based on her personal values and priorities. Dorothy selects **Family & Friends** as what matters most to her at this time. She feels that making progress in this area will enable her to focus next on improving her diet by reducing stress eating.

### Document a PCO Goal

Dorothy’s health coach uses motivational interviewing techniques to ask open-ended questions that elicit Dorothy’s initial personal goal to be more present when interacting with family and friends. By asking refining questions to rephrase the goal as a SMART goal (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound), Dorothy arrives at a personal goal that focuses on what matters most to her:

**SMART Goal:** I want to practice being present when interacting with family and friends in an uplifting way at least 3x monthly.

Dorothy’s health coach uses an additional motivational interviewing technique by asking her two questions about her readiness to pursue this goal. On a scale of 1 to 10, how important is it for you to… (your goal)?  On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you that you will be able to… (your goal)? Dorothy responds with scores of 8 and 3; important but not confident. Her coach asks what barriers might be causing her to have low confidence, and Dorothy responds that she has a lot of anxiety in social situations.

Together, they document all of these responses in a care planning system so that Dorothy’s choice of what matters most, her personal goal, her readiness ratings, and barriers are available to other members of her extended care team so that they all can help Dorothy to be successful.

#### Document a PCO Goal using Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)

Dorothy’s anxiety symptoms are causing substantial distress and interference with daily life activities. Dorothy is beginning to develop a phobia or fear of gathering with friends and family. She has declined many invitations to their gatherings and most recently her friends have stopped inviting Dorothy. Dorothy’s worrying is extending to loss of her family and friend connections and wants to overcome the phobia of gathering with family and friends. Dorothy’s primary care doctor, Dr. Anderson suggests Dorothy take a self-reporting questionnaire, formally known as a patient-reported outcome measurement (PROM) tool. The PROM tool is the GAD-7 indicating whether Dorothy has a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The GAD-7 tool will help Dorothy and Dr. Anderson with understanding and addressing her anxiety. 

Dr. Anderson explains that the GAD-7 tool assesses her symptoms, as well as their frequency, and severity or how difficult the symptoms are to manage over a two-week period. The tool is simple, reliable, easy to use, can be done online, and it can be used as a self-screening tool, removing any added pressure or anxiety associated with other tools. Dr. Anderson further emphasizes though this is a self-test online at home, creating a care plan together will yield the best results. Results, goals, and progress will all be documented in Dorothy’s medical record. The first time Dorothy answers the anxiety screening questions will be recorded as the GAD-7 baseline score. The final follow-up score will be determined by the two-week scoring results and Dorothy’s goals for reaching her desired goal. The objective will be relying on the GAD-7 score over time to benchmark where Dorothy is with her progress. 

Dorothy uses the online tool and answers seven questions on a four-point scale (refer to related profile links and other references section). The healthcare system computes a total score (potential of 21) from these answers, where a score from 0-4 being minimal anxiety, 5-9 indicating mild anxiety, 10-14 implying moderate anxiety, and a score from 15-21 carrying a sign of severe anxiety. Dorothy scores a 15 at baseline. This was a first step in identifying Dorothy’s scope of her anxiety level.

### Create a Care Plan

Dr. Anderson and Dorothy discuss the results and acknowledge that these feelings of anxiety should not be dismissed yet rather addressed through Dorothy’s goals for the next steps in care. Dr. Anderson explains that Dorothy’s baseline score of 15 indicates severe anxiety experiencing physical and behavioral symptoms of anxiety, and that it disrupts her ability to function. She is persistently or frequently anxious, and her anxiety may seriously affect her personal and professional life. Dorothy is startled by the ‘severe anxiety’ screening results and yet agrees that her behavioral symptoms of distress and fear of gatherings are heightened by intense negative interactions with family and friends. Dorothy withdraws in conversation and is avoiding gatherings as her phobia of the gathering activity is causing fear and she is worried about losing connections.

Dr. Anderson recommends therapy and medication to achieve success yet engages with Dorothy about what matters most to her. A plan can be created around her goal: ‘I want to practice being present when interacting with family and friends in an uplifting way at least 3x monthly’. Dr. Anderson suggests over the next six months, Dorothy will work with a counselor/health coach and take the GAD-7 anxiety assessment every two weeks until she decreases her score below 10 which reduces severe anxiety to mild anxiety. A score of 15 to under 10 is ideal indicating a significant improvement and a correlation with lowering anxiety. However, Dr. Anderson suggests that improvement is the most important aspect of demonstrating progress. A score of 10 is still meaningful and represents a clinically different result even though an ‘under’ 10 score is not achieved.

The PROM goal will be to achieve a GAD-7 score less than 10 or a clinically meaningful improvement of 20-40% within six months. Dorothy’s personal goal is to practice being present when interacting with family and friends in an uplifting way at least 3x monthly. The counselor/health coach will work with Dorothy to track her personal goal and they will track reducing the GAD score with lower scores demonstrating less anxiety and improved interaction. Dr. Anderson and Dorothy will use the GAD-7 score to quantify the change in score yet the work with the counselor/health coach is the actual activity impacting the change and making the progress to alleviate the phobia and worrying.

#### Track progress using using PROMs

Dorothy completes several GAD-7 self-assessments every two weeks and works with her health coach until she reaches a score of 9 and shares the Observation with the rest of her care team, where they all can track progress on attainment of Dorothy's PROM goal to achieve a GAD-7 score of less than 10.

The GAD-7 scores taken every two weeks demonstrate Dorothy’s progress and can be recorded in the health system’s EHR record. If the GAD-7 score increases or a spike is seen, the plan and goals need to be revisited. If Dorothy does not reach a 9 yet instead reaches a 10, this is still a clinically meaningful result and is considered successful. A visit with Dr. Anderson is recommended to document the final score and assess any next steps with treatment as well as the progress with Dorothy’s health coach.

### General Notes

☛ Many alternative tools have been developed and are in use that enable individuals to reflect on What Matters Most for their health & well-being. One example is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs [Whole Health approach to care](https://va.gov/wholehealth) that includes a [Circle of Health](https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTH/circle-of-health/index.asp) and [Personal Health Inventory](https://www.va.gov/WHOLEHEALTH/docs/PHI_Jan2022_Final_508.pdf). The examples in this FHIR IG are based on VA's approach, but can be adapted to other assessments used by different organizations or for targeted patient populations.
