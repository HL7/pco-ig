  <p>The <strong>"Plain Language Summary about HL7 and this Guide"</strong> is an experimental section that potentially
    could become a required part of HL7 FHIR implementation guides. The PCO IG team has agreed to incorporate this in
    the PCO guide and as part of ballot and ask for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Evaluation of whether or not it would be a useful section in a guide for non-technical and/or non-clinical
      readers.</li>
    <li>Evaluation of the content as written for the PCO guide, especially in terms of appropriate reading level and if
      fit for purpose.</li>
    <li>Evaluation of the presentation using an expandable button.</li>
  </ul>

    <h4>What is this guide about?</h4>
    <p><a href="http://hl7.org/">HL7</a>, which stands for Health Level Seven, creates standards to help different
      healthcare computer systems share information. One of the HL7 standards is HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare
      Interoperability Resources). It helps connect healthcare systems and applications used by clinicians and patients
      to share a wide range of information about their care that could include health conditions, medications, health
      goals, patient surveys, and much more.</p>

    <p>The HL7 FHIR Person-Centered Outcomes (PCO) FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) helps healthcare technology experts
      design systems that help doctors, health coaches, and other healthcare providers focus on what matters most to
      each person receiving care. It provides a standard way for healthcare systems to share and track information about
      a patient's personal health goals and outcomes.</p>

    <p>This guide supports two ways of measuring progress on person-centered goals:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS):</strong> A method where patients and providers set specific goals and
        track progress on a numbered scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROM):</strong> Standard surveys where patients share their own
        experiences about their health and progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Why is this important?</h4>
    <p>Many people, especially older adults and those with complex health needs, receive care that does not always match
      their personal goals. More than 14 million people in the U.S. need long-term care, and nearly 30% of Medicare
      patients have complex health conditions. This guide helps ensure that clinical and social care focuses on each
      person's unique goals—whether that’s being able to walk without pain, spending time with family, or managing a
      chronic condition effectively. As health care moves toward more personalized care and new payment models, we need
      clear standards for tracking and reporting patient goals. This guide helps care providers, researchers, and
      policymakers make sure care is truly centered on what each person wants and needs.</p>

    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
    <p>Goal-directed care is about working together to set and reach health goals. It includes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Identifying What Matters Most:</strong> Patients, with support from caregivers and their providers,
        create personal health goals.</li>
      <li><strong>Creating a Plan:</strong> A care plan is made based on these goals, including treatments, therapy, or
        lifestyle changes.</li>
      <li><strong>Tracking Progress:</strong> Patients and providers use tools to measure how well a person is reaching
        their goals and adjust care if needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>This guide helps different health IT systems and apps work together by setting clear standards for sharing and
      using goal-related data. It provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Steps to create and track person-centered goals in a care plan.</li>
      <li>Tools (GAS or PROM) to measure patient progress.</li>
      <li>Stories showing how different people use these tools.</li>
      <li>A list of standards for using FHIR (a system that helps different health IT systems and apps work together).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Who Can Use This Guide?</h4>
    <p>This guide is useful for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patients</strong> who want to set, track, and share their own health goals with their providers.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare providers</strong> who want to focus on personalized, goal-based care.</li>
      <li><strong>Researchers</strong> who study how goal-directed care improves health outcomes</li>
      <li><strong>Health IT developers</strong> who build systems that support this approach.</li>
    </ul>
